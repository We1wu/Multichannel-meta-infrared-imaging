File "Images and Labels":
	"Normal_Image.mat" is the original image data simulated by using single-channel array (SCA) sensor.
	"Normal_Image_NoFinger.mat" is the original image simulated  by SCA sensor for curled fingers imaging.
	"Sensor_Image_new.mat" is the simulated image generated by "Normal_Image.mat" using multichannel array (MCA) photodetector.
	"Sensor_Image_NoFinger.mat" is the simulatied image generated by "Normal_Image_NoFinger.mat" using MCA detector.

The code in the File "Lorenz" shows the process of generating images using the original images in "Sensor_Image_new.mat" and "Sensor_Image_NoFinger.mat".  Additionally, the simulated results of the 6-channel detectors using Lorenz fitting method and their parameters are contained in this File. 

Running "Test.m" will call the function "MCA_Sensor.m" to display the simulated results.

All image data and labels used in the simulations are provided in the File "Images and Labels".

The datafiles of simulated results are located in the director of "Simulation Results".
